Hello everyone, I'm Muhammad Ramzan, a Full-stack Software Developer with experience in web scraping and data analysis. In my previous job, I collected over 10,000 company profiles and gathered scholarship details using web scraping techniques with Python, Selenium, and Pandas. The data volume was quite large, and I faced challenges dealing with website changes, managing large amounts of data, and ensuring data accuracy.

However, with my problem-solving skills and technical expertise, I overcame these challenges and delivered valuable data for the company's projects. I'm passionate about using data to drive insights and decisions, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge.

If you're looking for a full-stack software developer to help you gather, visualize, and analyze data at scale and build web applications, let's connect and discuss how I can add value to your projects or organization!
